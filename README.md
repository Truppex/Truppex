# Hi, I'm Truppex 👋

I'm an apprentice IT specialist for system integration.  
I really enjoy playing League of Legends and lately also Wuthering Waves.  
I'm also a big anime fan and love listening to music my favorite genres are Phonk and sometimes hardstyle, but honestly, I listen to pretty much everything.

In my free time, you'll usually find me playing League, watching anime, or just messing around with code as a hobby.
